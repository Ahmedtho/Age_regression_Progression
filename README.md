# AI-powered Facial Morphology for Missing Person Identification

## Project Overview
The increasing number of missing person cases highlights the urgent need for innovative and effective solutions to reunite families with their loved ones. AI-powered Facial Morphology for Missing Person Identification leverages advanced artificial intelligence to address this critical issue. The platform allows families to upload images of missing individuals, enabling an AI model to perform age progression or regression based on the time elapsed since the person was last seen. This predicts how the individual might appear at a different age, aiding in recognition even after many years.

Additionally, the system incorporates facial similarity matching, identifying potential matches between uploaded images and notifying relevant users, such as families and the individuals themselves. By facilitating a community-driven approach, the platform enhances the likelihood of identification through collaboration and shared visibility.

The project emphasizes data security and privacy, adhering to ethical standards and providing users control over their data. Through the integration of cutting-edge AI models, real-time notifications, and a user-friendly interface, this project presents a novel, scalable, and impactful solution for addressing the challenges of finding missing persons.

## Project Objectives
- Provide an AI-Powered Platform for Missing Children:
Create a platform where families can upload images of their missing children for identification and search purposes.

- Age Progression and Regression:
Use AI models to predict how a child's facial features might change over the years to help locate children who have been missing for an extended period.
Allow users (e.g., grown-up children) to reverse the process by uploading current images to approximate their childhood appearance.

- Similarity Matching and Notifications:
Implement facial similarity algorithms to identify matches between uploaded photos, notifying families and individuals when a potential match is detected.

- Community Collaboration:
Facilitate a community-driven approach by sharing AI-generated images widely on the platform to increase chances of recognition.
